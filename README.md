# Introduction

This small project of mine displays a personal profile card, providing an introduction to who I am and the skills I have been developing whilst training as a full-stack developer. The purpose was for me to practise fundamental React concepts such as components and props. Apologies in advance if you don't enjoy colour very much!

## Instructions

- Clone the repository onto your device
- Open the folder in your code editor
