# Introduction

This small project of mine displays a personal profile card, providing an introduction to who I am and the skills I have been developing whilst training as a full-stack developer. The purpose of making this was for me to practise fundamental React concepts such as components, props, conditional rendering and list rendering.

## Instructions

- Clone the repository onto your device
- Open the folder in your code editor
- Run the command "npm i" in the terminal to install all the dependencies
- Run the command "npm start" in the terminal and the profile card will open in your browser
